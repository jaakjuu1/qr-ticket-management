# New Component Structure

## Component Name
- The name of the component should be descriptive and follow the naming conventions of the project.

## File Structure
- Each component should have its own directory.
- The directory should contain the following files:
  - `ComponentName.js` or `ComponentName.jsx` for the component logic.
  - `ComponentName.css` or `ComponentName.module.css` for the component-specific styles.
  - `ComponentName.test.js` for the component tests.
  - `index.js` to export the component.

## Component Logic
- The component should be a functional component.
- Use React hooks for state and lifecycle management.
- PropTypes should be used for type-checking the component's props.

## Styling
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling.
- Follow the project's naming conventions for class names.
- Ensure styles are scoped to the component to avoid conflicts.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for the component using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Ensure all possible states and edge cases are tested.
- Aim for high test coverage.

## Documentation
- Add comments to explain complex logic within the component.
- Update the project's documentation to include the new component.
- Provide examples of how to use the component in the documentation.
