# QR Ticket Management Application

## Project Overview
- A Progressive Web App (PWA) for managing QR-based tickets in an amusement park setting.
- Built with Node.js, Express, SQLite, and React for the frontend.
- Three user roles: Basic User, Device Manager, and Admin.

## Project Setup
1. **Initialize the Project**
   - Create a new directory: `qr-ticket-manager`
   - Run `npm init -y` to initialize the project
   - Set up Git repository

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Backend: `npm install express sqlite3 sequelize jsonwebtoken bcrypt cors`
   - Frontend: `npm install react react-dom react-router-dom @material-ui/core qrcode`
   - Dev tools: `npm install -D nodemon eslint prettier jest`

## File Structure
- The project should have the following directory structure:
  ```
  /project-root
  ├── /src
  │   ├── /components
  │   │   └── ComponentName.js
  │   ├── /styles
  │   │   └── ComponentName.css
  │   ├── /tests
  │   │   └── ComponentName.test.js
  │   ├── /db
  │   │   └── database.sqlite
  │   ├── index.js
  ├── /public
  │   └── index.html
  ├── package.json
  ├── .eslintrc.js
  ├── .prettierrc
  └── README.md
  ```

## Component Architecture
- Each component should be modular and reusable.
- Components should be stored in the `/src/components` directory.
- Follow the naming conventions for files and directories.

## Database
- Use SQLite for the database.
- Store the database file in the `/src/db` directory.
- Use an ORM like Sequelize or Knex.js for database interactions.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Ensure the project is a PWA by adding a service worker and a manifest file.
- Store the service worker and manifest file in the `/public` directory.
- Follow best practices for PWA development to ensure offline capabilities and performance.

## Development Workflow
1. **Setup**
   - Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
   - Set up any necessary environment variables and configuration files.

2. **Development**
   - Write code following the project's coding standards and best practices.
   - Ensure components are modular and reusable.
   - Use appropriate design patterns.

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for components and features using Jest.
   - Ensure all possible states and edge cases are tested.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure components work well together.

4. **Documentation**
   - Add comments to explain complex logic within the code.
   - Update the project's documentation to include new components and features.
   - Provide examples of how to use components and features in the documentation.

6. **Deployment**
   - Merge the feature branch into the main branch.
   - Deploy the project to the appropriate environment.
   - Monitor the deployment to ensure the project is working as expected.

## Post-Implementation
- Gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
- Monitor the project for any issues or bugs.
- Plan for any future enhancements or iterations based on feedback.
